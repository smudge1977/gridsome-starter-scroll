Client comments...
'Such a heavenly massage! Calming, soothing and at the same time energising. In my Thai Yoga Massage session Jane had created a decorative and beautiful ambience with scents to transform the room to a relaxing haven. Jane's expertise touch was sensational and she had a natural intuition and sensitivity to my needs. I loved every second of the refreshing 1.5 hour treatment. I really enjoyed the variation of stretches in which some were playful and opening whereas others I drifted off to sleep. It was bliss. Can't wait for the next one!'...Nicky via Facebook
