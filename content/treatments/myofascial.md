Myofascial release or MFR is applied with a sustained, gentle pressure allowing the fascia to elongate naturally. Tissue becomes softer and more pliable, fascial restrictions are released returning it to its normal resting length. 

No oil or wax is used and during the treatment sensations can vary from tingling, tightness, heat, cold and sometimes emotions and old memories may occur. You'll be supported and secure during this process.

Fascia is the tough connective tissue holding our bodies together. It's a 3D continuous web of elastin and collagen fibres that envelops every structure in the body including our muscles. 'Myo' meaning muscles. It varies in thickness depending on the area of the body. The collagen provides strength, the elastin the elasticity, it's normally fluid and pliable with the ability to move without restriction. However, restriction in one area can affect every other area, in both the fascia itself and the structures it surrounds. These can develop due to many factors including physical and emotional trauma, poor posture, repetitive strain and scaring. Fascia, like muscle has the ability to contract and relax playing a major role in mobility and stability of joints.

How can MFR benefit you?
Myofascial release can help if you have any chronic pain condition or injuries too painful for regular massage. In addition, with MFR I can work with areas of scarring including caesarean, hysterectomy and mastectomy scars, helping to increase movement, reduce adhesions and improve the appearance of keloid scars. MFR has all the benefits of massage and can be a stand alone treatment or can be mixed with deep tissue massage.

'I have been seeing Jane around once a month for many years now. She has taken great care of my back, neck and shoulders, always listening carefully to me and my body. I can always trust Jane to look after me and my body feels so much better for it. Jane will also advise on exercises to do at home to help with whatever problem I'm suffering from at the time. I have recommended her to my husband, my mum and friends - everyone who has been to see her has felt th benefits. Thank you so much, Jane!'...J.C. Haywards Heath
