Studies show massage to be effective during pregnancy and both thai massage and holistic massage are safe throughout all stages of pregnancy, giving you the lasting benefits of stress reduction, relief from aches and pains as well as being deeply relaxing.

Each massage is unique to your needs and requirements. Great care is taken with comfort and positioning with you lying on your side fully supported with pillows. The Thai pregnancy massage takes place on a futon with you wearing loose no oils are used. Additional work in seated or semi-reclined is also possible. Holistic pregnancy massage uses safe and neutral oil, with all areas not being massaged covered.

Postpartum Massage
Receiving a massage after baby has arrived can help your body with recovery from child birth as well as postural pain from holding or breast feeding your baby. It's safe to receive as soon as you feel ready although if you have had a caesarean, it's best to check with your doctor or midwife, usually 6 weeks is fine.
