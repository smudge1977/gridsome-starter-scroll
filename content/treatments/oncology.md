Oncology massage can be highly beneficial for people who have had a cancer diagnosis. it can help relieve the symptoms of cancer or side effects of treatments such as chemotherapy related fatigue, depression, nausea, insomnia, and pain. 

Sore muscles and scar tissue can be eased and range of movement increased as well as giving an emotional lift, helping to manage stress and anxiety. Massage can also help stimulate your digestive system and increase relaxation by encouraging deeper respiration. It's not however a treatment or remedy for cancer but can be received in conjunction with conventional treatments.     

Adaptions and modifications may be needed depending on your current stage of health. These may include using a slower lighter touch, changes to the length of a session as well as site restrictions. Considerations are taken with positioning and avoiding any areas affected by cancer, such as tumour sites or lymph nodes. A face massage and/or scalp massage, foot massage or hand massage can be as equally beneficial and comforting.
