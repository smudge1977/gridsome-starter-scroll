Reflexology is a natural holistic therapy that works on reflex areas of the feet or hands. The anatomy of the body is reflected in miniature on your feet and contains reflex zones that correspond to all the major organs and glands.

Applying pressure to these areas stimulates the body’s own healing process, freeing and releasing energy to restore balance and promote deep relaxation. 

Reflexology is suitable for all ages and may bring relief from a wide range of acute and chronic conditions. It helps us to cope on a physical and emotional level thereby encouraging us to heal and maintain health in all areas of our lives. Reflexology has many of the same benefits as body massage and perfect for ease of accessibility. I use a refreshing natural mix of tea tree and mint or unscented vegan wax for the treatment.

This age old traditional treatment has been practised in Asia for well over 2500 years but only in the 1930's Eunice Ingham developed the foot reflexology charts. These show how particular parts of the foot relate to other parts of the body. Less research than massage is available but studies show that Reflexology may help with pain reduction. 

Thai foot massage uses a blend of refreshing essential oils for massage and stretches of the feet, ankles and lower legs. It's a balancing and holistic treatment which can help boost general health and well-being, promoting deep relaxation, improving sleep and is extremely beneficial for stress relief. It helps reduce stiffness and improve flexibility of the feet and ankles as well as stimulating the circulation of these areas. 

Reflexology and Thai foot massage can be combined.
