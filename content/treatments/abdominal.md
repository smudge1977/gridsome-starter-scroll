Asian Abdominal massage helps stimulate our internal systems naturally to allow for optimal function and maintaining health. It's deeply relaxing and really helpful if you have any bloating, constipation or other digestive issues.

Abdominal massage is comprehensive approach to energise, strengthen and detoxify the internal organs with the focus on the digestive system. The soft abdomen is an area that frequently has problems due to the food and drink we consume, the environment we live in, the toxicity we breathe in, and the stresses we experience in our daily lives.

Emotions are stored within our internal organs, include those of trauma, grief, and stress. This may result in depression, low energy levels and inflammation. If we are experiencing congestion in this area, it can greatly impact on our vitality and energy and decrease the effectiveness of our complex digestive system, therefore our physical and emotional health can benefit from this form of massage.

The stomach can be a delicate and vulnerable area, I work sensitively using a listening touch on your abdomen to detoxify, replenish, tone and energise the internal organs. I work firstly on the skin and fascia, releasing adhesions and with permission working on scar tissue. Then gradually working deeper to release abdominal muscles and stimulate the digestive organs, unblocking restrictions helping improve the flow of energy to the area.

Encouraging the bodies wellbeing, massage of the abdomen may help emotionally with stress, depression & anxiety and physically help manage or reduce:

 Bloating
 Irritable Bowel Syndrome
 Abdominal Cramps / Pain
 Acid Reflux
 Constipation
 Digestive problems
 Wind
With the first session I will take a detailed consultation, if you have a chronic digestive condition a series of treatments may be needed. I use coconut oil so please let me know if you are allergic to this.

For maximum comfort during the session wearing either loose or stretchy trousers / leggings and for women a sports type bra top is ideal. I will be working on your abdomen only and your clothes will be protected by towels.

Abdominal massage isn't a replacement for medical care so If you have and new, unusual, severe or painful symptoms please see your GP first.
